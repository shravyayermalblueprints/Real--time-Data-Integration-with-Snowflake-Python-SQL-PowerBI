In this project, I successfully executed a complete data warehousing lifecycle, from data modeling and schema design to data loading, querying, and visualization using Python, Snowflake, and Power BI. My key accomplishments include:

ER Diagram Design
Initiated the project by analyzing business requirements and designing comprehensive Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams. This laid the foundation for structuring the data warehouse by identifying key entities, attributes, and relationships to ensure data consistency and scalability.

Star and Snowflake Schema Implementation
Based on the ER model, I developed both Star and Snowflake schemas to organize fact and dimension tables effectively. These schema designs optimized query performance and supported analytical use cases, balancing normalization and reporting efficiency.

Test Data Generation Using Python
Created realistic and scalable test datasets using Python libraries like Faker, NumPy, and Pandas. Automated the data generation process to simulate millions of records, enabling robust testing and validation of the data warehouse workflows.

Snowflake Configuration and Object Creation
Set up and configured the Snowflake environment, including virtual warehouses and user roles. Designed and created databases, schemas, staging tables, permanent tables, and views to facilitate structured data storage and querying.

Loading Data into Snowflake
Implemented automated data loading pipelines using Python and Snowflake Connector for Python. Utilized staging areas, bulk COPY commands, and data validation scripts to ensure accurate and efficient data ingestion into Snowflake from CSV and JSON formats.

Scenario-Based SQL Queries
Wrote and executed complex SQL queries in Snowflake to handle real-world business scenarios such as cohort analysis, time-series reporting, customer segmentation, and multi-level aggregations. Optimized queries for performance using clustering and caching mechanisms.

Report Blueprint Creation
Designed detailed report blueprints that outlined the structure, key metrics, filters, and visual layouts of each dashboard. This step ensured alignment with stakeholder expectations and guided the efficient development of analytical reports.

Report Generation Using Power BI
Connected Power BI directly to Snowflake and developed interactive dashboards that provided actionable insights. Incorporated features such as slicers, drill-downs, and KPIs to enable dynamic data exploration and informed decision-making.
